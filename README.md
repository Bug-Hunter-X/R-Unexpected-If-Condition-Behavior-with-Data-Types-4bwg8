# R Unexpected If Condition Behavior with Data Types

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior with `if` conditions and data types in R.  The code shows how data type mismatch can lead to unexpected outcomes. The solution offers a way to handle potential data type issues, making the code more robust.

## Bug Description
The bug involves using `if` conditions to check data types within a data frame and performing operations based on those types. The code might unexpectedly fail or behave in unexpected ways if the data type is not consistent with what the code is checking for. 

## Solution
The solution shows how to use explicit type checking with appropriate error handling or data type conversion to handle inconsistencies and avoid unexpected behaviors.
